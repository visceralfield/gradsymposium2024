In {{Y|Caves of Qud}}, it is not just bodies and social relationships that are open to mutation, it is also the videogame itself. Is there a theoretical framework we can use to make sense of this capacity for mutation in a videogame?

“The forum theater, one of [Boal's] most popular techniques, {{Y|re-enacts the same play several times}} by allowing different audience members to get into the stage and take the protagonist's role[…] improvising possible solutions to the problem that is being staged. Boal's ultimate goal is not to find an actual solution to the crisis[…] but rather to {{Y|create an environment for debating not just through verbal communication but also through performance}}. Forum theater perfectly fits the definition of simulation: it models a system (the oppressive situation) through another system (the play)[…]”

“The pleasure in Boalian drama is given not by its seamless three-act structure but by the opposite: the ability to interrupt and modify it. {{Y|Simulations are laboratories for experimentation where user action is not only allowed but also required}}. Coherence from session to session is simply not a requirement in the game world[…] {{Y|The key trait of simulational media is that it relies on rules: rules that can be manipulated, accepted, rejected and even contested.}}”

                      {{Y|Simulation rules are ideological.}}

Four ideological levels in simulational media:

&#x07; {{W|representation}}, such as the characteristics of objects and characters, which is also found in traditional narrative media;

&#x07; {{O|manipulation rules}}, or what the player is able to do within the simulation;

&#x07; {{R|goal rules}}, or what the player must do in order to win the game;

&#x07; {{M|meta-rules}}, which, by their inclusion in a simulation, state how the other rules can be changed.

“We must make it newly possible to conceive of futures beyond the household, the family, and the Child as we know them. This[…] must be grounded in {{Y|the opening up of currently curtailed choices, and in the creation of the ideological and material infrastructures required to synthesize new desires as accessible, feasible choices}}[…]”

“What I am describing here might be thought of as a form of counter-social reproduction - that is, as social reproduction against the reproduction of the social as it stands. {{Y|Mutation is not a process that can be programmed in advance, but rather a phenomenon that might be encouraged, fostered, or facilitated via the practices of xeno-hospitality}} - just as the replication of the same is cultivated via the elaborate memeplex of reproductive futurity.”

This capacity in the game's meta-rules is co-emergent with both the evolving creative practices of the game's primary developers and {{M|a community of players whose ethos reflects this same xeno-hospitality}}.

“Despite their colloquial designation and sale as games, videogames do not have rules. Rules are voluntary constraints and social contracts. They are pacts between players not to peek or move outside invisible boundaries. [Videogame] mechanics, on the other hand, are ontological operations. Players have no choice but to work within the limitations of these involuntary systems.”
