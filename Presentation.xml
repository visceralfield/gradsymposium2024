Roguelike videogames are traditionally characterized by:
&#x07; Procedurally generated levels
&#x07; Text-based or very minimal graphics
&#x07; Simulation-driven turn-based gameplay on a 2D grid
&#x07; Playing many distinct runs punctuated by player-character death

{{W|Qud}} is a game already very thematically concerned with mutation.


On top of the huge possibility space of the game's simulation and procedural generation systems, text files can be used to add, remove, or modify:
&#x07; Physical objects
&#x07; Creatures and their body plans
&#x07; Locations
&#x07; Social groups and relationships
&#x07; Genders and pronouns
&#x07; Conversation scripts
&#x07; ...etc.

    Simulations are laboratories for experimentation where user action is not only allowed but also required. Coherence from session to session is simply not a requirement in the game world… {{Y|The key trait of simulational media is that it relies on rules: rules that can be manipulated, accepted, rejected and even contested}}."
